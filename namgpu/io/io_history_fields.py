"""io-history-fields: wrfout-shaped history fields on device, from the NMMB state.

Unit io-history-fields (mode "new"); kernel namgpu/kernels/io_history_fields.cu:
  hist_moist_theta (grid_2d, LM levels), hist_ph (grid_cols, LM+1 interfaces), hist_surface (2-D),
  hist_refl_conv (grid_cols: REFL_10CM with the convective rain, and COMPOSITE).
Reads  : T, Q, CW, F_ICE, F_RAIN, PD [JM,IM] (or [LM,JM,IM]); FIS, PINT (LM+1), ACPREC_TOT, CUPREC_TOT [m];
         UE10, VE10 = earth-relative 10 m winds on H points, written by io-wind-rotate (dep, must run
         before this unit; it raises if they are absent); Z (state, midlayer). Grid: psgml1, sgml2 (ctx.tables).
         UEARTH, VEARTH = earth-relative winds on H points, LM levels (io-wind-rotate). W, TSHLTR, QSHLTR
         (state). REFL_10CM (LM levels) only when the Ferrier microphysics (phys-fer-calmict) has
         written it; history REFL_10CM and COMPOSITE add the convective-rain reflectivity (_refl_conv), from
         CPRATE, CNVTOP and T.
Writes (scratch via st.add, names H_*): H_P, H_T, H_QVAPOR, H_QCLOUD, H_QRAIN, H_QICE, H_QSNOW, H_PH,
         H_PSFC, H_HGT, H_RAINNC, H_RAINC, H_COMPOSITE, and H_CW_SPEC, H_FICE_SPEC, H_FRAIN_SPEC when
         spec_adv is on (see "Condensate" below).
Returns: dict  name -> (device array, dims) for io-history (history.write_history). Names:
         PSFC, HGT, T (theta-300), PRES (full mid-layer pressure, Pa; NOT WRF's perturbation P, and
         there is no PB, so no reader may add a base state), PH (g*Z, m2 s-2, interfaces), QVAPOR,
         QCLOUD, QRAIN, QICE, QSNOW (mixing ratios), U10, V10 (earth-relative), RAINNC, RAINC (mm),
         SNOWNC (grid-scale snowfall since start, mm water, RAINNCV*SR summed as WRF's SNOWNC; phys-fer-driver),
         U, V (earth-relative at mass points, LM levels, not WRF's staggered U/V), W (LM levels),
         T2 (2 m temperature from TSHLTR theta and PSHLTR), Q2 (QSHLTR), MSLP (MEMBRANE_MSLP, Pa, when
         io-quasipost-driver ran for this output; it sets ctx.quasipost_done), and REFL_10CM and
         COMPOSITE when the Ferrier field exists. With the configfile key history_handoff: true also the
         parent hand-off set (HANDOFF_FIELDS below: skin/SST, sea ice, soil, snow, canopy water, land mask) and
         the parent grid keys as global attributes (handoff_attrs); off, the field list is unchanged.
Launch: kernels and the small array ops on ctx.stream, no host sync, no per-step allocation after
the first call.

Owners and conventions (review of io-history-fields, 2026-11-04):
  Z.      Midlayer height. dyn-cdzdt-nonhydro writes it every step (Fortran z(i,j,l) = zlo + dz/2,
          module_DYNAMICS_ROUTINES.F90:3075); init-derive-state writes the same convention at init, so the
          0 h history is consistent. Interfaces are rebuilt here from FIS: zint(l) = 2 Z(l) - zint(l+1).
          The state table (parm/nam_solver_state.txt) says "Height at midlayers". Z[LM] is not used.
  Accumulators. ACPREC_TOT is the total precip since start, convective plus grid-scale (Fortran
          module_MICROPHYSICS.F90:548 and module_CONVECTION.F90:619); reset only at restart output
          (module_SOLVER_GRID_COMP.F90:10317), which is not ported yet. CUPREC_TOT is a port addition,
          the convective total since start, because the Fortran keeps only the NPREC bucket CUPREC,
          which drv-bucket-reset empties every NPREC steps. RAINC = CUPREC_TOT, RAINNC = ACPREC_TOT - CUPREC_TOT.
          Neither is the bucket.
  Condensate. Only the fer and fer_hires microphysics are ported (UPDATE_WATER, module_SOLVER_GRID_COMP.F90
          11144-11200). Other microphysics refuse. With spec_adv=F the state CW, F_ICE, F_RAIN are the
          output. With spec_adv=T (ELSE branch 11169-11200) the output condensate is rebuilt from QC, QR, QS
          here, read-only. At step 0 (CLD_INIT) the CW path is used, as the Fortran F branch does.
          Declared gap: the step-path write-back of that ELSE branch (CWM, F_ICE, F_RAIN in the state) is not
          ported yet, so physics under spec_adv=T still reads the state values.
  EPSQ. 1e-12 (nmm/module_CONSTANTS.F90 "epsq=1.e-12", same as nmmb_common.cuh NMMB_EPSQ). Checked.
