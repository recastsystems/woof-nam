"""init-native-atm: decoded NAM bgrd3d00 hybrid-level fields -> NMMB state (cold start).

Unit: init-native-atm (group init, mode new). Kernel: namgpu/kernels/init_native_atm.cu, one
launch of kernels.grid_2d(IM, JM, LM). No host sync, no per-step allocation.

Inputs (float32 device arrays decoded from the GRIB2 bgrd3d00 file and placed in ctx.st.fields;
layout [LM, JM, IM] for 3-D, [JM, IM] for PSFC; l = 1 is the model top):
  TMP (K), SPFH (kg/kg), UGRD, VGRD (m/s, as NPS writes them), CLMR, CICE, RWMR, SNMR (kg/kg),
  PSFC (Pa).
Mapping flags come from the NPS namelist (cfg.direct_temp, cfg.do_clouds, cfg.vcoord; NAM CONUS:
direct_temp=.true., do_clouds=.false., vcoord=1). See the kernel header for each term's source.

Outputs written into ctx.st (CONTRACT names): T, Q, U, V, CW, W, Q2, F_ICE, F_RAIN, F_RIMEF
(3-D [LM, JM, IM]) and PD ([JM, IM]).

Not done here: PINT and the vertical coordinate (init-vcoord-recover), the GRIB2 decode itself
(init-grib2-decode), and the boundary strips.
