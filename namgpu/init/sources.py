"""Init sources: one table row per analysis source, staged into the state the init chain reads.

This is the NPS replacement's front half. NAM was retired on 2026-11-03 12Z, so (CONTRACT "Init after
NAM retirement"):
  native  the archived NAM native B-grid analysis (bgrd3d00), valid only for cycles before the
          retirement. Same grid and levels as the model: no interpolation.
  gfs     GFS 0.25 deg analysis (pgrb2.0p25 f000) for any date, interpolated onto the rotated B grid
          and the NMMB hybrid levels by the init-gfs-* units (nemsinterp port), gfs_start.py.
  parent  our own WOOF-NAM history (a run with history_handoff: true): a one-way nest on its own grid,
          parent_start.py (start) and parent_bocos.py (boundaries).
  ifs     ECMWF open data IFS HRES 0.1 deg (from 2026-10-20 12Z), the same isobaric path; ifs-0p25 for
          earlier cycles (from 2025-03-14 12Z; snow from the same-cycle GFS where the file has no sd/rsn).
          Record tables and conversions: source_records.py.
  era5    ECMWF ERA5 reanalysis 0.25 deg, hourly, 00/06/12/18Z starts from 1940-01-01 00Z to about 6 days before
          today, the same isobaric path: start and boundaries are ERA5 analyses (hindcasts and case studies). Read
          without an account from Google's public ARCO-ERA5 store by gpuwm's own ERA5 route (gpuwm.era5_arco, Rust
          Zarr bridge) and decoded by gpuwm's regular-forcing NetCDF reader (source_records container
          "regular-netcdf").
  hrrr, rrfs  table rows for the same isobaric path. They are refused by name today: their files are
          on Lambert-conformal grids (GRIB2 GDT 30) and init-grib2-decode places only GDT 0 and 32769
          (a Lambert grid read as lat-lon puts every point in the wrong cell). Not done.
Adding a source is a row in SOURCES (file pattern, kind, grid), never a new code path.

Entry: stage(ctx) is what the chain stage init-grib2-decode runs when it is called with no file
(init_grib2_decode.run(ctx)). It reads ctx.init_source or ctx.cfg.raw["init_source"] (default
"native") and fills:
  ctx.st      TMP SPFH UGRD VGRD CLMR CICE RWMR SNMR PRES [LM, JM, IM] (top first), PSFC, HGT_M,
              SOILHGT, FIS [JM, IM]; for the native source also TCOND, FICE, FRAIN, RIME, TKE
              [LM, JM, IM] (the analysis' own condensate, fractions and TKE; init-native-atm reads them).
  ctx.st      PSHLTR, TSHLTR (2 m theta), QSHLTR, U10, V10 (grid-relative, H points), TH10, Q10 [JM, IM]
              from the source's 2 m / 10 m analysis (shelter_state), as NMMB reads them from its input.
  ctx.tables  raw_sfc (init-native-sfc input), soil_hydraulics (Noah STAS SOILPARM b, psi_s, theta_s),
              grid_source (receipt: source row, file, level order found).
