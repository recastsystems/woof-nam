"""Fetch one case's inputs from AWS NODD into cases/<case>/raw/ (parallel, byte-range subsets), for any domain.

    python -m namgpu.init.fetch_case --cycle 2026110412 --hours 48 [--config parm/nam_configfile_X]
        [--source gfs] [--boco-age 6] [--case-dir DIR] [--dry-run]

What is fetched is the FETCH_ROWS table: one row per source file family, with the archive's date range, its
path template per era, the record subset, the role (init / boco / referee / truth) and the region it covers.
A row is planned only when the cycle is inside its archive dates and the domain (the configfile's grid, every
H point) overlaps its region; anything else is skipped with the reason printed. Adding a source or a region
is a row here, never a new code path.

Rows today:
- gfs-f000   GFS analysis (init), global: 2021-01-01 00Z on from the NOAA S3 archive (subset by .idx byte ranges
             to the records the start reads: pressure levels, surface, soil, snow, ice, canopy water); before it
             the archived eras of GFS_ERAS (NCAR GDEX 0.25 deg from 2015-01-15, NCEI 0.5 deg analyses from
             2004-03), whole files. Written where sources.SOURCES["gfs"]["file"] expects it.
- gfs-boco   GFS 0.25 deg forecast leads every boco_interval_h covering the run, from the cycle boco_age_h
             older than the start (SOURCES["gfs"]: 6 h as operational NAM; 0 h for past cases), global.
- nam-*      NAM native B-grid analysis bgrd3d00 (the native start), native surface bgrdsfFF and the grid 218
             awphysFF picture referee: only where the domain overlaps the NAM 12 km grid, only for cycles
             before the NAM retirement (2026-11-03 12Z).
- mrms       MRMS MergedReflectivityQCComposite_00.50 (truth), the file nearest each hour, only where the
             domain overlaps MRMS CONUS (20-55 N, 130-60 W).
All requests run in a thread pool (I/O bound); nothing here is a single-core stage.

Any other init source with a "fetch" entry in sources.SOURCES (ECMWF open data IFS 0.1 / 0.25 deg):

    python -m namgpu.init.fetch_case --cycle 2026110312 --hours 48 --source ifs

fetches that row's start and boundary leads (every 3 h, the row's own cycle) into cases/<case>/raw/, by the row's
record selection on the ECMWF jsonl .index beside each object (byte ranges, adjacent records merged), its hosts in
order (a host that refuses the index or an object is skipped), plus the row's donor fields (GFS f000 ICEC by .idx).
One output file per lead: the selected records of the lead's objects concatenated, and the row's f000_only
records (the surface geopotential z, published at step 0 only) appended to every later lead. Prints the bytes.

A row whose fetch kind is "arco-zarr" (era5) is fetched by gpuwm's own ERA5 route, gpuwm.era5_arco.retrieve_era5_arco
(Google's public ARCO-ERA5 Zarr store, no account): one NetCDF per boundary time into the row's per-time folder, the
latitude band of the run's domain (the configfile grid, plus the row's margin) and every longitude. The store's own
bounds document is read first, so an hour past its last published day is refused with that day.
