"""drv-h-to-v-tend: H_TO_V_TEND, add the H-point wind tendencies to the V-point winds.

Fortran: nmm/module_H_TO_V.F90:128-224 (H_TO_V_TEND_3D, DELTA_T = DT*NSTEPS in single precision),
called from SOLVER_RUN at two sites, one per branch:
  branch "nphs" : module_SOLVER_GRID_COMP.F90:5586 (DUDT -> U) and :5588 (DVDT -> V). Inside
                  turbulence: IF(CALL_TURBULENCE) (5475-5664), CALL_TURBULENCE =
                  MOD(NTIMESTEP,NPHS)==0 (5175). NSTEPS = NPHS. Runs after TURBL, which writes
                  DUDT/DVDT (zeroed at module_TURBULENCE.F90:451, GWD added at 1311).
  branch "bmj"  : module_SOLVER_GRID_COMP.F90:5827 (DUDT -> U) and :5830 (DVDT -> V). Inside
                  wind: IF(CONVECTION==sas .or. bmj) (5813-5863), inside convection:
                  IF(CALL_PRECIP .AND. CONVECTION/=none) (5722-5867), CALL_PRECIP =
                  MOD(NTIMESTEP,NPRECIP)==0 (5176). NSTEPS = NPRECIP. Runs after CUCNVC (5732),
                  which writes DUDT/DVDT through its DUDT_PHY/DVDT_PHY arguments (5768). The
                  phys-bmj-driver glue aliases those names to the same arrays (see that unit).
Scope exclusion: module_SOLVER_GRID_COMP.F90:6998 and :7000 (H_TO_V_TEND with NPHS, inside
gfs_physics, 6401-7059, fed by 6958) are NOT ported. They run only when gfs is true, and
parm/nam_configfile sets gfs: false. The wrapper refuses if the config asks for gfs.
The sas branch (5813, convection sas) is not ported and refuses by name.

Reads : DUDT, DVDT [LM,JM,IM] (H points; unit-owned, added to ctx.st by st.add on first call).
Writes: U, V [LM,JM,IM] (V points) in place.
Scalars: DELTA_T = DT*NSTEPS, single precision, formed on the host exactly as the Fortran
(NSTEPS = NPHS for "nphs", NPRECIP for "bmj"). IM, JM, LM from ctx.grid.
The driver gates each call on its cadence (namgpu/driver.py: "nphs" and "nprecip" keys); this
wrapper does not repeat the gate.

Two launches per branch (one per Fortran call: U then V). No host sync, no per-step allocation.
