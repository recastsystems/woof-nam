"""phys-rad-cal-cldfra: CAL_CLDFRA, cloud fraction from condensate.

Fortran: nmm/module_RADIATION.F90:1045-1134 (NAM nam.v4.2.11, 83df4e13c1), SUBROUTINE CAL_CLDFRA.
Called from RADIATION (module_RADIATION.F90:470) in the lwrad CASE DEFAULT branch only, and only
when RADIATION's own gate passes (module_RADIATION.F90:412-414): not both LW and SW off, and
ITIMESTEP == 1 or MOD(ITIMESTEP, NRAD) == 0. The 12 km NAM configuration uses longwave rrtm, which
takes CASE (RRTMLWSCHEME) and does not call this routine (RRTM computes its own cloud fraction),
so this unit is not reached on the proof path.
Kernel: namgpu/kernels/phys_rad_cal_cldfra.cu (phys_rad_cal_cldfra, one thread per (i, j, l),
        one launch, no host sync, no per-step allocation after the first call).

Reads:   QC, QI [LM, JM, IM] (state table fields, see parm/nam_solver_state.txt).
Writes:  CLDFRA [LM, JM, IM] (state table, H point), interior cells only:
         Fortran i = 2..IM-1, j = 2..JM-1 (ITS_B1..ITE_B1, JTS_B1..JTE_B1 on a single card);
         the boundary rows and columns are left as they were.
Flags:   F_QC and F_QI are the microphysics switches of module_SOLVER_INTERNAL_STATE.F90
         (fer, fer_hires: F_QC on, F_QI off; wsm6, thompson and gfs: both on). Any other
         microphysics name is refused, as the Fortran STOPs on it.
